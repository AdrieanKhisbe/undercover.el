A test coverage library for [Emacs Lisp](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/index.html).

## Notes

`undercover.el` is on earlier stage of development and has some important issues:

- it assumes a certain development cycle of your package (using [Cask](https://github.com/cask/cask), [ert-runner](https://github.com/rejeep/ert-runner.el), [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) and [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/));
- it based on `edebug` and can have some issues with errors and macros coverage.
